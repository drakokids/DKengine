Why a new game engine?
-There are no good and simple game engines to use in Delphi IDE
-Firemonkey lacks some functionalities to be used for games
-Delphi is very easy to use, why not use it also for games?
-Old engines existed before, but now they are not up to date
-If we do not need advanced engines ( Like Unity, Unreal or Unigine )
-if we do not have time or pacience to learn how to use this other engines
-If I already know how to use delphi ( or other previous visual IDE's )
-It will work on weaker machines and week gpu cards
-It will be used to continue making my own games

It's Free?
-Yes, it will be free
-It will be developed in free time, so any help will be great
-The games and projects produced with it can be used for free projects payed projects
-If you need support on this engine, I will be glad but it cannot be free of course
